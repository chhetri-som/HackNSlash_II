# Hack & Slash II

This project is a step-by-step implementation from a playlist by 'RyiSnow'. I would recommend him if any are interested in 2D game dev.

This is the second half of the game. It has more game features implemented to convert it from a treasure hunting game
to a role-playing game. The resources from the first game have been modified and further advanced.

Here are some of the implementations listed apart from the first half of the game development:
- NPC - dialogue interaction
- Inventory System - equip, store and use items
- Diagolue Screen - subwindow for dialogue texts
- Character Stats - subwindow for player stats
- Monsters - hit detection, enemy health bar and items drop on killing monster
- Projectile - shooting fireballs and rocks
- Tile Based Event - healing pool, damage pit and teleportation
- More Interactive Tiles - heart, mana, shield, sword, potion, coin, axe
- Environment Interaction - cutting of trees
- Basic UI - title screen, game over screen, options menu, pause screen
- Player Stats - health, mana and character level-up based on exp gained
- Map Update


However, there are a few more things that I would like to implement which I will list below. Adding these would personally
feel better and make the game feel more complete:
- Parry system (I have implemented a shield system however it has not function yet other than just appearance)
- Trading system (You can obtain coins in the game but the currency has no implementation as of yet)
- Overall visual graphics (The game looks very basic graphically so i wanted to make it look more appealling visually)
- Multiple maps (The game currently has only one 60x60 map)
